<h1>Welcome to demo site for laravel-blog</h1>
<p>This is a very basic laravel app to demonstrate the capabilities of the <a href="https://github.com/retosteffen/laravel-blog" target="_blank">laravel-blog</a> package.</p>
<p>Go to <a href='/blog'>blog</a> to see the features and learn what I configured after including the laravel-blog package.</p>

<p>You can see the code for this app <a href="https://github.com/retosteffen/blog-demo" target="_blank">here.</a></a>
